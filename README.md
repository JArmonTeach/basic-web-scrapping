# Web Scrapping App

## Project Description
This Python program web scrapes text and inserts it into PowerPoint slides. 

Python 3.8.5 was used so as to learn its basic syntax and semantics. This also allowed to learn how to web scrape with BeautifulSoup and how to automate a PowerPoint presentation using the pptx library.

A challenge that came about when formatting the scrapped text unto the PowerPoint slides. The solution of checking the original HTML formatting of the text, adjusting how to split the text based on the website's formatting and then looping through the process to create the slide, format the text and insert it into the slide will be helpful for future uses of scrapping data from a website. In other projects, it will help to understand how the text is organized and how to clean that data for better use.
